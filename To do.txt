- Manage to quit the application after an error (keeps running even after all windows were closed)
- Reorganize models' titles organization

- Finish EHitboxDialog
- Finish ESelection
- ETabTreeView's main slots and signals
- Translate system

	- The reloading feature is cool but it's stupid : no need to reload a language file when it's already loaded...
	- Delete the namespaces for model titles
